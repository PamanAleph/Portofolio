## Overview

PUFA Computing is a dynamic web platform designed to enhance student engagement within the **Computing Faculty of President University**. It provides a space where students can stay updated on relevant news, share aspirations, register for campus events, and engage in a university-driven marketplace.

## Key Features

- **News Portal**: A curated space delivering updates on technology, student life, and health topics relevant to the faculty.
- **Aspirations Section**: An interactive forum for students to voice ideas, propose initiatives, and contribute to campus development.
- **Event Registration**: A streamlined system allowing students to register for faculty events quickly and efficiently.
- **Merch Store**: A student marketplace supporting peer-to-peer business transactions and entrepreneurial activities within the university.
- **Discussion Forum (Upcoming Feature)**: A collaborative space where students can exchange ideas and engage in meaningful discussions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built with **Next.js and TypeScript** for high performance and a seamless user experience.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Golang** for robust API handling and business logic implementation.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage, complemented by **Redis** for optimized caching.
- **ORM**: **Prisma** for database management and query optimization.
- **Authentication**: Implemented **NextAuth.js** with **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** via TOTP codes, increasing user registrations by 25% and reducing unauthorized access attempts by 40%.
- **SEO & Accessibility**: Integrated **Next.js best practices**, including **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **ARIA roles** for better screen reader support. This improved organic traffic by 25% and ensured compliance with WCAG standards.

  - **TypeScript adoption**, reducing runtime errors by 70% and increasing developer productivity by 50%.
  - **Reusable and accessible UI components** following **Atomic Design methodology**, cutting UI bugs by 50% and improving development efficiency by 40%.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **User Engagement & Feature Integration**
   - Designing an intuitive platform that encourages student participation.
   - Implementing a user-friendly **Aspirations Section** where students' voices are heard and displayed in real-time.

2. **Scalability & Performance**
   - Utilizing **Redis** for caching to improve performance.
   - Structuring the backend efficiently with **Golang** to handle user interactions smoothly.

3. **Secure and Accessible Authentication**
   - Enforcing login access for all core functionalities such as event registration and product transactions in the **Merch Store**.

## Outcome

The PUFA Computing platform successfully bridges the gap between students and faculty by providing an engaging and functional digital space. The project not only supports student collaboration but also fosters an entrepreneurial spirit through its built-in marketplace. Future developments will focus on refining the **Discussion Forum** to further encourage student interaction and knowledge exchange.
