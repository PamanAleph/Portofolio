## Overview

The **Train Ticket Management System** is a web-based platform that enables users to book train tickets, reserve seats, and complete payments effortlessly. As a **Frontend Developer**, my role was to build an intuitive and responsive user interface using **Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS**.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Building UI Components**: Developed reusable and modular UI components for ticket booking, seat reservations, and payment processing.
- **Integrating API with Next.js**: Connected the frontend with the backend via RESTful API, ensuring seamless data flow.
- **Ensuring Mobile Responsiveness**: Implemented **TailwindCSS** to provide a consistent and adaptive design across devices.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Utilized **Next.js features** like **server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)** for improved SEO and fast load times.
- **Implementing Secure Authentication**: Integrated authentication and session management to ensure secure user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) for an optimized web experience.
- **TypeScript** – Ensuring type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for efficient and maintainable styling.
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** – Managing API requests efficiently with automatic caching.
- **Zustand** – Lightweight state management for handling user data and seat selection.
- **Headless UI** – Implementing accessible and customizable UI components.

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Handling Real-time Seat Selection**
**Challenge:** Seat availability needed to update dynamically without requiring a full-page refresh.
**Solution:** Implemented **WebSockets** and React state management to reflect seat selection in real-time.

### 2. **Ensuring a Smooth Booking Experience**
**Challenge:** Users required a step-by-step booking process with minimal friction.
**Solution:** Designed a **multi-step form** for ticket selection, seat reservation, and payment confirmation.

### 3. **Optimizing SEO & Accessibility**
**Challenge:** The platform needed to be discoverable and accessible to all users.
**Solution:** Utilized **Next.js SSR/SSG**, added **ARIA attributes**, and followed **WCAG guidelines**.

## Outcome

The Train Ticket Management System now provides an intuitive and streamlined experience for booking tickets, reserving seats, and making payments. The use of **Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS** ensures a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall booking process.
